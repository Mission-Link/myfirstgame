# myfirstgame
It seems that literally everyone has created their own game. So I will not stand idly by and make one for me!

In final stage this will be a 3rd person shooter game with side or top down view.
Game will contain previously created game classes hierarchy that are not implemented yet because
I had not enough time and zeal to make a game out of that.
